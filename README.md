# Northwind_SQL_Project

Northwind Database – SQL Practice Project (My First SQL Project)

This project contains 20 real-world SQL queries solved using the classic Northwind Dataset.
As a beginner data analyst, I created this project to practice key SQL skills such as:
1.Retrieving and filtering data
2.Using JOIN across multiple tables
3.Aggregations with GROUP BY, HAVING, ORDER BY
4.Calculating revenue, averages, totals
5.Identifying top-selling products, suppliers, employees
6.Customer and order analysis

Each query is written with a real business use-case, such as:
✔ Top 5 most expensive products
✔ Total revenue for specific orders
✔ Best-performing employees
✔ Loyal customers (more than 5 orders)
✔ Product categories by revenue
✔ Orders handled by each shipper

This project helped me strengthen my understanding of MySQL and build confidence as a fresher in data analysis
